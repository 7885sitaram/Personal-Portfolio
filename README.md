🔗 Live: [Deployed on Netlify]

📁 Code: [GitHub Repository Link]

🧠 Project Overview:

I developed a fully responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my frontend development skills, career timeline, and technical achievements. This project reflects my proficiency in React, modern UI design, and interactive web experiences.

🛠️ Key Features & Technologies Used:

📚 React Concepts:

Used React Router DOM for seamless multi-page navigation.

Implemented React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for efficient state and lifecycle management.

Applied props and reusable components for better scalability and performance.


💅 Styling & Layout:

Designed a clean, minimal, and fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.

Integrated GSAP animations for engaging transitions when users land on the site.

Included hover effects, icon sets, and animated backgrounds for visual appeal.


🔗 Functional Components:


About, Profile, Portfolio, Testimonial, Blog, Contact sections to display detailed career info and skills.

Resume Download & View: Users can view or download my resume directly from the site.

Contact Form + Google Maps Integration: Users can send direct messages and view my location.

Projects Section: Includes links to live demos (hosted on Netlify) and source code (on GitHub).


🎯 Highlights:

Focused on user-friendly UX with mobile-first design.

Smooth and optimized animations using GSAP.

Interactive project showcase with direct access to code and live demos.

Designed with accessibility and performance in mind.


📌 Why This Portfolio Stands Out:

Demonstrates real-world React practices (routing, reusability, state management).

Highlights strong UI/UX principles using Tailwind and custom animations.

Built for HRs, recruiters, and collaborators to quickly grasp my skillset, personality, and technical strengths.
